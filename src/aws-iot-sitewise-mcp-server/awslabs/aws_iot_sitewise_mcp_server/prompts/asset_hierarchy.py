    Generate a comprehensive analysis and visualization of AWS IoT SiteWise asset hierarchies.

    This prompt provides detailed analysis of asset relationships, properties, and health status.

        asset_id: The ID of the root asset to analyze

    Returns:
        Comprehensive asset hierarchy analysis and visualization
    """
    return f"""
You are an AWS IoT SiteWise expert helping to analyze and visualize asset hierarchies.

Please analyze the asset hierarchy starting from asset ID: {asset_id}

Follow these steps:

1. **Root Asset Analysis**:
   - Use describe_asset to get detailed information about the root asset
   - Extract asset name, model ID, properties, and hierarchies
   - Note the asset status and creation/update dates

2. **Asset Model Analysis**:
   - Use describe_asset_model to understand the asset model structure
   - Identify property definitions, data types, and units
   - Document any composite models or hierarchies defined in the model

3. **Child Assets Discovery**:
   - Use list_associated_assets with traversal_direction="CHILD" to find all child assets
   - For each child asset, recursively analyze their structure
   - Build a complete hierarchy tree

4. **Property Analysis**:
   - For each asset in the hierarchy, analyze all properties
   - Use get_asset_property_value to get current values where possible
   - Identify measurement, attribute, transform, and metric properties

5. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Use list_time_series to identify associated time series
   - Check for any disassociated time series that might be relevant

6. **Visualization Output**:
   Create a comprehensive report including:
   - ASCII tree diagram of the asset hierarchy
   - Table of all assets with their key properties
   - Summary of data flow and relationships
   - Recommendations for optimization or monitoring

7. **Health Check**:
   - Identify any assets with FAILED status
   - Check for missing property values or stale data
   - Suggest maintenance actions if needed

Format your response as a structured analysis with clear sections and actionable insights.
Include specific asset IDs, property names, and current values where available.

If you encounter any errors, explain what information is missing and suggest alternative approaches.
